        <h1>Snow-Obsessed Dog Discovers Amazing Snow Cave And Moves In Every Time She Crosses It</h1>
        <img style="width:100%;height:auto;" src="https://petloverspage.netlify.app/uploads/58727.jpg">Apparently, pandas are not the only ones that like snow. Other animals, such as elephants, bears, cats, and dogs can probably lose them with joy playing with snow. Echo is an example of that. She is a Samoyed dog who adores snow since she was little, according to her mother, Jennifer Wang.

“She enjoys burrowing her entire head in fresh powdery snow and digging tunnels big enough to suit her entire body!” she told <a href="https://www.thedodo.com/">The Dodo</a>.

On a hiking trip with her mom and her mom's cousin, little Echo found a snow cave that could fit a person inside. While Wang and her cousin were excited to peek inside it, Echo seemed to be a little worried because she could feel something ominous in the cave.

However, it was not long before she realized it was safe. She tried putting herself in the cozy little snow cave, and ended up falling in love with it. They stopped at the cave for a while before they could coax out of it and continued hiking.

However, when they came across the cave a few days later, once again, Echo moved in and refused to go out of the fascinating cave. The cave was her discovery the first time, and this time, she was also the one to locate the cave.

“The second time we went on that same hike the entrance to the cave was almost entirely covered up, but she knew exactly where the cave was,” Wang said. “She dug through the blockage and slipped right back into her cave. This time she was in there for quite a while, munching on snow, and just laying down and chilling (literally)!”

“Echo was not happy when we decided to leave to continue the hike,” Wang explained. “We called for her to come out several times, but it wasn’t until we pulled out her treat pouch that she finally agreed.”

In the future, Echo will follow her family on other hikes, but she never stops hoping for a chance she can be taken back to the cave again. Let's share beautiful Echo with your family and friends.
