<div><h1>Needle Felted Animals Crafted By Canadian Artist Will Definitely Make You Want One</h1>
<p>Crafters all around the world what an intricate and addicting needle felting is. A Canadian crafter named Teri Gullon is an expert at needle felting. </p><p>She creates such cute little animal sculptures from wool. And they are so small that they can easily hold in your hand.</p><p>As opposed to the usual needle felter, Gullon makes miniature animals. So you can imagine the effort that goes into giving them minute details. </p><p>Gullon says while explaining her creative process, “When I first discovered needle felting, my goal was simply to create something adorable to make me smile. I became immediately addicted, literally pulling all-nighters to finish a piece.”</p><p>She says while explaining why her collection has so many sea creatures,  “Being from Nova Scotia, I have spent a lot of time on and in the ocean, so many of my sculptures are inspired by marine life. I also like the contrast of creating something that lives in the ocean from an unexpected medium like wool.” </p><p>There are a variety of other animals that she has made that are very realistic looking. She said while talking about them, “Some of my pieces are meant to be lifelike, others are just cute and colorful.”</p><p>Talking about her craft Gullon explains how it works, “Think of teasing your hair to create knots, only more permanent. I have a variety of needles, which serve different functions, but the principle is the same.” </p><p>She further adds, “My style of needle felting involves making the wool very dense to allow for more details, which is extremely time-consuming. Out of curiosity, I did the math, and this means for something I made in 20 hours, I stabbed it roughly 400,000 times!”</p><p>Scroll down to see the amazing work of Teri Gullon.
